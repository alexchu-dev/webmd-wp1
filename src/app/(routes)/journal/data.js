    content: `<p>My little romance in Paris. There is nothing more romantic than laying on the grass under Eiffel Tower, sipping a glass of win and enjoying the sunset with your loved one. Even if you have to sit outside in a couple of freezing hours of darkness just to stand in the shadow of one of the biggest towers in the world. And if you aren&apos;t a Parisian yet, you will surely be by the end of the trip.</p><p>From this romantic spot, you can get the most beautiful view of the tower and enjoy the whole city of Paris with an amazing sunset.</p><img src='/img/paris/tony-lee-8IKf54pc3qk-unsplash.jpg' alt='Paris' class='w-full' /><p>Lutèce Tower in Paris</p><p>A tiny tower that symbolizes the end of the beginning of French history. Eiffel Tower is just a part of the City of Light, while Lutèce Tower symbolizes the beginning of Paris. You can find it in the museum district of Paris, near the underground station of Lutèce. It is named after Louis-Philippe I, King of the French, who reigned from 1824-1844.</p><p>The tower looks like a small spaceship that was built and designed by Henri Sauvage, one of the most famous French designers and engineers of all times. It is a well preserved monument, with multiple levels, a metal staircase and a wonderful view of Paris.</p><p>It is also a very spectacular spot to see the world&apos;s tallest free-standing tower, the Tower of Pisa in Italy.</p><p>The Eiffel Tower</p><p>The end of romance. It&apos;s pretty much obvious. Most of the romantic things in Paris have to do with seeing Eiffel Tower, so you might as well be able to watch it from Paris itself.</p><p>Enjoy the amazing views of the Paris Tower and surrounding landmarks, which are always beautiful, while enjoying the atmosphere of the city.</p><p>You can take a quick stroll along the Champs-Elysees, the most famous avenue in Paris. Turn down a few more streets and enjoy the shopping area of the Marais. Make it all the way to the center of Paris, which will take you quite a few hours.</p><p>When you are all done with all that, enjoy one more cocktail on the city streets, just like in the movies. You will probably go home very tired, but will definitely have a great experience.</p><p>If you like this post, make sure to share it to your social networks.</p>`,
