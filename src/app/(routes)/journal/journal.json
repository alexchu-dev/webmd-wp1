    "content": "<p>My little romance in Paris. There is nothing more romantic than laying on the grass under Eiffel Tower, sipping a glass of win and enjoying the sunset with your loved one. Even if you have to sit outside in a couple of freezing hours of darkness just to stand in the shadow of one of the biggest towers in the world. And if you aren&apos;t a Parisian yet, you will surely be by the end of the trip.</p><p>From this romantic spot, you can get the most beautiful view of the tower and enjoy the whole city of Paris with an amazing sunset.</p><img src='/img/paris/tony-lee-8IKf54pc3qk-unsplash.jpg' alt='Paris' class='w-full' /><p>Lutèce Tower in Paris</p><p>A tiny tower that symbolizes the end of the beginning of French history. Eiffel Tower is just a part of the City of Light, while Lutèce Tower symbolizes the beginning of Paris. You can find it in the museum district of Paris, near the underground station of Lutèce. It is named after Louis-Philippe I, King of the French, who reigned from 1824-1844.</p><p>The tower looks like a small spaceship that was built and designed by Henri Sauvage, one of the most famous French designers and engineers of all times. It is a well preserved monument, with multiple levels, a metal staircase and a wonderful view of Paris.</p><p>It is also a very spectacular spot to see the world&apos;s tallest free-standing tower, the Tower of Pisa in Italy.</p><p>The Eiffel Tower</p><p>The end of romance. It&apos;s pretty much obvious. Most of the romantic things in Paris have to do with seeing Eiffel Tower, so you might as well be able to watch it from Paris itself.</p><p>Enjoy the amazing views of the Paris Tower and surrounding landmarks, which are always beautiful, while enjoying the atmosphere of the city.</p><p>You can take a quick stroll along the Champs-Elysees, the most famous avenue in Paris. Turn down a few more streets and enjoy the shopping area of the Marais. Make it all the way to the center of Paris, which will take you quite a few hours.</p><p>When you are all done with all that, enjoy one more cocktail on the city streets, just like in the movies. You will probably go home very tired, but will definitely have a great experience.</p><p>If you like this post, make sure to share it to your social networks.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Machupicchu is a place where you can feel the ancient Inca civilization. The stone buildings, the terraces, and the steps are all made of stone. The Machupicchu ruins are located in the province of Cusco in the Cusco region of the Andes. Its name comes from a word meaning “ancient mountains,” and it was a place for spiritual meditation in ancient times.</p><p>Among the ruins of Machu Picchu are the Royal Halls, which date back to the 15th century. They were once used by the leaders of the ancient Inca Empire to talk to the gods. Machu Picchu is a sacred place and is now considered the origin of the Inca civilization.</p><p>The tallest stone building is called the Temple of the Sun, and it is the oldest building in the Machupicchu ruins. The sun is the most sacred god in the Inca mythology. It is said that the emperor Atahualpa gave this place to his wife, Cuca, and ordered her to build it in the shape of a pyramid. The buildings all have a round roof. It was a very important place that is considered an important ancient spiritual center.</p><img src='/img/machupicchu/peru-2774925_1920.jpg' alt='Machupicchu' class='w-full' /><p>According to ancient mythology, the sun god was the one responsible for giving life to the universe. He is a very important figure in the ancient indigenous beliefs of the Americas, and he was considered the creator of the universe. Machu Picchu was the perfect place to place religious rituals because of the two mountains.</p><p>Next was the Temple of the Moon. It is considered the oldest building in the Machupicchu ruins. The ruins of Machu Picchu were an ancient sacred city that was destroyed in the 16th century by an earthquake. The sun temple is now located inside a mountain near the entrance. The moon temple is located inside a sacred area. It is a sacred place to worship the moon god and Machu Picchu is considered the birthplace of the ancient culture of the Incas.</p><p>While Machu Picchu was a sacred place for the ancient Incas, they also made it a place where the gods of the sun and moon could get a good view of the ruins, and they could see the people coming in and out of the city.</p>"

    "content": "<p>My wonderful Okinawa trip starts from Naha. It was a beautiful way to reach there, though it was a long way. On the way, there was a gentle rain shower which made me get a little wet.</p><p>Getting to Okinawa from Naha Airport takes almost 2.5 hours (60 minutes for domestic flights) for the non-commercial planes, and roughly another 1.5 hours for the military ones.</p><p>On Okinawa, you can find a direct flight from Australia, China, New Zealand, South Korea and Japan. I found out about a low-cost carrier flying from Cairns, Australia, to Japan. You can fly into Tokyo for around $100 and then board an overnight ferry to Okinawa.</p><p>It was the cheapest way to get there and the most comfortable as I could sleep the whole way.</p><img src='/img/okinawa/underwater-7557528_1920.jpg' alt='Underwater' class='w-full' /><p>Upon reaching Okinawa, it was really exciting. I saw lots of tall and fat trees in Okinawa and especially compared to Australia where I saw mostly short and round trees.</p>p>Compared to my hometown of Saring, Okinawa is more tropical. I really enjoyed the weather and I was really happy to come back to a green forest after a long, grey desert trip.</p><p>But overall, Okinawa is a place I will never forget.</p>"
